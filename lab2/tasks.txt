Write two separate C programs that work together to demonstrate dynamic memory allocation, process creation, and execution of a different program.

Program 1: Parent Program (parent.c)
 - Allocate an integer array of size 12 using malloc.
 - Initialize the array with values from 10 to 21.
 - Print these values to confirm successful memory allocation and initialization.
 - Use fork to create a child process.
 - In the child process, use exec to replace the child’s code with a separate program (child.c).
 - The parent should wait for the child to finish.
 - Free the allocated memory in the parent after the child has completed.

Program 2: Child Program (child.c)
 - Print a message showing PID and PPID.
 - Allocate an integer array of size 7 using calloc.
 - Print the initial values of this array.
 - Use realloc to expand this array to a size of 10.
 - Set the new elements (from index 5 to 9) to values 101 to 105.
 - Print the expanded array to confirm the correct allocation and initialization of new elements.
 - Change the array size to 4.
 - Print array
 - Free the memory
